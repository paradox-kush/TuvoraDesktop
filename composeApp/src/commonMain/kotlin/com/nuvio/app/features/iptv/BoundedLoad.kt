/**
 * THE loading rule for IPTV and Live TV (repo-root CLAUDE.md, "every loading state has a deadline and a
 * terminal outcome").
 *
 * Why it exists: "Live TV spins forever" was fixed three times, one path at a time — B76 (Stalker lineup on
 * iOS), 10-08 (direct-source autoplay never settling), 10-09 (a channel that failed to open reconnecting
 * forever) — and came back a fourth time as a hub skeleton waiting on a provider that trickled bytes. Each
 * fix closed one path; the cause stayed: any loading flag could be switched on with nothing guaranteeing it
 * ever switched off, and a failure was often read as "empty".
 *
 * The invariants, all enforced here (and by ArchitectureTest R7, which forbids entering a loading state
 * anywhere else in features/iptv and features/livetv):
 *  1. Every load ends: [LoadStatus.Loaded], [LoadStatus.Empty] or [LoadStatus.Failed]. A failure is never Empty.
 *  2. A load that makes no progress for its surface's [LoadSurface.stallMs] ends as Failed(timedOut) — a stall
 *     deadline, not a total one, so a big but healthy playlist import keeps going while it reports progress.
 *  3. [LoadStatus.Loading] carries its own deadline, so the UI ends the wait at it even if the work never
 *     returns (a blocking call that ignores cancellation) — see [effectiveAt].
 *  4. Every page-level outcome is reported (`iptv_load`), so a regression shows up in PostHog within a day.
