/**
 * One channel's history, fetched lazily and kept on disk.
 *
 * Three rules shape this, all of them memory rules rather than feature rules:
 *
 * - **The FOCUSED channel only, never a prefetch.** A guide page holds dozens of rows; fetching
 *   each one's full table is how 2 MB becomes 40 MB. The channel the viewer is actually watching
 *   is the one whose past they can act on.
 * - **Single-flight per channel.** The guide asks on scroll, on channel switch and on travel, and
 *   those overlap freely; concurrent fetches would stampede a panel that frequently allows one
 *   connection in total.
 * - **SQLite is the heap.** Rows go from the stream parser to the database and are read back a
 *   window at a time with the description truncated in SQL. Nothing holds a channel's table.
 *
 * Xtream only. `tv_archive` is an Xtream concept; M3U and Stalker playlists already ingest their
 * guide wholesale through XMLTV / bulk EPG, and their catch-up needs a different (server-built or
 * `catchup=`-attribute) URL story that this lane does not open.
