 * What changes once the thing playing is a recording rather than a live feed.

 * (the Android engine selection depends on it), so the difference is a flag carried BESIDE the
 * content type rather than a new type — StreamVault's shape, and the one that doesn't ripple
 * through every `contentType` comparison in the app. Every live-only behaviour then reads
 * `live && !isCatchUpPlayback`.
 *
 * Pure policy: the gates, the scrub clamp and the failure classification are all decidable from
 * values, so they are pinned by tests rather than by playing a real replay on someone's account.
