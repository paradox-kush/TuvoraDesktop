/**
 * Architecture enforcement (rules doc Rule 6) — the mechanism that makes the design stick. JVM-only:
 * Konsist is a static source scan, so it runs once on the host test set, not per platform.
 *
 * Fork side = UPSTREAM-ABSENT paths (verified via `git cat-file -e origin/cmp-rewrite:<path>`), NOT a
 * features/ name list: fork-only code also lives under core/{analytics,diag,memory,rec} and as a few
 * files inside shared dirs. RE-VERIFY the fork set at every upstream sync.
 *
 * Baseline-and-ratchet: ~200 pre-existing objects + 26 crossing files cannot be greened today, so the
 * baseline in [ArchBaseline] freezes them; the test fails only on NEW violations and the baseline only
 * shrinks (each seam deletes its entries). A wrong fork set bakes wrong entries into the baseline —
 * and baseline entries are forever — which is why the set is computed, not guessed.
